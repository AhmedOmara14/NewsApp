## Overview

Recently migrated from Hilt to Koin for dependency injection.

## Why Koin?

- **Simplicity and Ease of Use:** Koin is known for its simplicity and a user-friendly DSL for dependency injection. This has made our codebase more readable and accessible, especially for developers new to DI.
- **No Code Generation:** Unlike Hilt.
- **Runtime Dependency Injection:** Koin performs dependency injection at runtime.
